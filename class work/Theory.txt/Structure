                                        Structure
                                                                               <<05-02-26>>
->structure is a use difined data type which is contain similar and dis-similar data type eliments
->structure which is on kide of group which contain dis-similar data type eliments

Array    vs    structure

(1) Array
->array can contain only similar data eliment in single variable
(2) structure
-> structure can contain multiple  eliments of different data type in a single variable

Syntex:

struct<structure name>
{
    data type variadble name1;
    data type variadble name2;
    data type variadble name3;
    .....
};

                                Nested structure
                                                                               <<09-02-26>>
-> structure can be declare inside another structure is called nested structure
->too way to declare nested structure
(1) declare nested structure inside the main structure
(2) declare nested structure outside the main structure

(1) declare nested structure inside the main structure
struct student
{
    int rollno;
    char name[20];
    struct address
    {
        char city[20];
        char state[20];
    }inner object;
}outer object;

(2) declare nested structure outside the main structure
struct address
{
    char city[20];
    char state[20];
};
struct student
{
    int rollno;
    char name[20];
    struct address add;
};
