Constructor:
-> constructor is a most powefull concept of C++ constructor is a special member function
<or we can say that constructor is a special method>

->witch is invoke automatically whnever we creat object of class

-> it's usally work for initilization of member

NOTE: Constructor does not have any return type and constructor always declare in publice
mode.

->constructor name and class name sude be same we can't take different name.

syntax:
class <class name>
{
    public:  
    data members

    constructor:
    {
        body of constructor
    }
}
-------------------------------
ther are 3 type of constructor

1)  defualt constructor
2)  parameterized constructor
3)  copy constructor

1) defualt constructor

-> dose not  contain any parameter when we want display or do some static value we can use 
defualt constructor.
=========================================
2) parameterized constructor

-> when we pass parameter at object crreation time it's called parameterized constructor

:::this pointer:::

-> thois pointer wich is refer current class object means we can change class member using of this pointer
=========================================
3) Copy constructor

this is special constructor which is creat new object using of existing object
{ye jub ham main me se kuch pass karte hai tab use hota hai }

syntax:

constructorname (const classname &obj)
{
    ....
}
hear & means address of

                                       Destructor :
                                                                               <<20-02-26>>
distructor:
-> mainly work to destroy object whenever we close our block of code it will automatically
destroy object after use same like constructor declare in public mode as destructor declare
declare in public mode

->but in destructor we have to add (~ till sign) in prefix and same name as class name

syntax:

    ~classname
    {
        //body
    };
