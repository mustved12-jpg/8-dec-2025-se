                                       Polymorphism: 
                                                                               <<20-02-26>>
-> poly means many and morphism means froms

-> one method has different forms its called polymorphism
-> polymorphism is derived from greek word means one class can contain same name multipule
method

-> ther are 2 types of polymorphism

1) method overloading - compiler time polymorphism
2) method overriding - run time polymorphism

---------
1) compiler time polymorphism
-> which is also know as early binding and static polymorphism
->which is achieve by method overloading and operator overloading

2) run time polymorphism
-> which is acheiv by method overriding(inheritance) and virtual function
-----------
Method overloading:

when one class can contain same name multipule methods its called method overloading

product:
    ->click event
    (image)
    (button)
    (text)

not: same name method with diffirent signature (diffirent parameters)
---------------
Method overriding:

-> when parent and child both have same name method and same name arguments
its called method overriding

symtax:
        class parent
        {
            public:
            void display()
            {

            }
        };
        class Child:public parent
        {
            public:
            void display()
            {
                
            }
        };
        main()
        {
          Child obj=Child();
          obj.display();
        }
