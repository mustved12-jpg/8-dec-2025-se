                       Access specifier or Visibility mode
                                                                               <<18-02026>>

ther are 3 types of Access specifier

1) public
2) private
3) protected

-> in structure by default all members are public but in class by default all members are private so we have to define in public mode.

1) public:
-> we can access class properties from anywher inside the class and outside the class

-> anywhere from the programe

2) private:
-> private means private data-even child class can't use private class data member and member function

-> so, private provide data protection and data hiding in cass functionality

-> only own class can access

3) protected:
->protected is a similar like private but protected member can access by own class child class

-> own class and child class.

                                     Inheritance
                                                                               <<18-02-26>>
Inheritance:
->Inheritance is a most powerful concept of Oops concept
->Inheritance provide reusability so we can reduce our work and save development time
->Inheritance provide parents and child relationalship

ther are 5 types of inheritance:

1) single level inheritance
2) multi level inheritance
3) multiple inheritance
4) hierarchical inheritance
5) hybrid inheritance

-> inheritance is a part of relationalship so it represent IS-A relationalship
   
   parent - child (100% utility of parent's properties)

-------------------------------
1) single level inheritance:

->parent and child relationalship its called single level inheritance

    A   (parent)

    |
    V 

    B   (child)

    syntax:
    class Parentclass
    {
    };
    class Childclass: <access Specifier><Parentclass>
    {
    };
    main()
    {
        Childclass obj;//not prent class
    }
----------------------------------------
2) multi-level inheritance:

-> Extended level of multi level inheritance

syntax:

class A//class A is a super class or base class or parent class
{
};
calss B//class B is a intermediate parent class
{
};
class C// c;class C is a sub calss or derived class or child class
{
};

--------------------------------------
3) multiple inheritance:

->in this inheritance ther are more then one parent class and one child class

-> mens one child can have more then one parent or we can say that multiple parent class

-> but in real world multiple inheritance not supported becouse in real world two parent are not possible that's why java does'n support this concept

-> multiple inheritance the main aim to achieve multiple parent's functionality in one chile class

syntax:

class parent1
{

};
calss parent2
{

};
class child:<access spacifier>parent1,<acces spacifier>parent2
{
    
};

-> nut ther are possaibility of ambiugity(confusion between same name properties)
