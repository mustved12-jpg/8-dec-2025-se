                                            OOPS                               <<16-02-26>>
opps: object oriented programing

CLASS:
->class is a collection of different different data members

->class is a collection of elements
->class is a user difined data type

syntax:
class <class name>
{
    public:
    data members;
    members function();
};
----------------------------
OBJECT:
->object is a instance of class or we can say thet object is a variable of class

->using of object we can access properties of class

syntex:
classname object=classname();
------------------------------
Constructor:
-> constructor is a most powefull concept of C++ constructor is a special member function
<or we can say that constructor is a special method>

->witch is invoke automatically whnever we creat object of class

-> it's usally work for initilization of member

NOTE: Constructor does not have any return type and constructor always declare in publice
mode.

->constructor name and class name sude be same we can't take different name.

syntax:
class <class name>
{
    public:  
    data members

    constructor:
    {
        body of constructor
    }
}
-------------------------------
ther are 3 type of constructor

1)  defualt constructor
2)  parameterized constructor
3)  copy constructor

1) defualt constructor

-> dose not  contain any parameter when we want display or do some static value we can use 
defualt constructor.

2) parameterized constructor

-> when we pass parameter at object crreation time it's called parameterized constructor
