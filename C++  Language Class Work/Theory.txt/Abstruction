                               Abstruction:
                                                                               <<21-02-26>>

Abstruction: is a concept which provide only few information not allocated background 
information 

-> the main aim of abstruction concept is to achieve data hiding and hide 
implementation

-> abstruction is a concept which is only achieve by abstruc class and abstrucmethod

---------------
Abstruction method: / pure virtual function:

-> pure virtual function means function dose not contain implementation 
-> adstruction method which is indicate by pure virtual function means withot
body only method declaration.

syntax:
    vitrual<returntype>functionname=0;

            A 
--------------------------
|                        |
B                        C

at the time of inheritance there no data hiding between two choild so resolve this 
situation we can use abstruction concept here
-----------------------

abstruction class:

-> a class which can contain abstruction method its colled abstruction class
