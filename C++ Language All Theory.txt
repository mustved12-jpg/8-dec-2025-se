What is C++ ?
->c++ is an extend varsion of c language
-> C language +1
->c+1
its showing postfix increment
-----------------------------------------
pop        vs      oop

(1)pop
-> praceduare oriented programing language
   wich is mainly focus on functions our all programs divid in chunks of functions

(2)oop
->object oriented programing language
  everythings depends on object
---------------------------
C++:

->C++ is an object oriented programing language it was developed by ((bajarne stroustrup)) at AT & Bell Lab in 1983.

->simula was the first object oriented programing language it was developed during 1960s by kristen nygaard and old dhal

->stroustrup had initially given the name "C with classes" to C++ in 1989, the name was changed to C++.

->C++ can be used to write procedural as well as object oriented that's why C++ is also called a hybride language.
-----------------------------

::object based and object oriented language::

->the language which supports the class and object but does not support the inheritance and
polymorphism is called object based language

->the object-oriented language supports all the features such as class,object,inheritance,
polymorphism,etc.

(1)<oop>object oriented programs              |   (2)<pop>procedure orianted programs

->data and functions are combined together    |-> data an function are not cobined together
                                              |
->all features of pop may be present in oop   |->it dose not supports the features of oop

->the ffollows the bottom-up dessign concept  |->it follows the top-down design concept
___________________________________________________________________________________________

(Advantage of oops)
-> secarity:The data and functions are combined thogether and the data can be made hidden from the outside world so that
 security of data increses.

->reusability:new objects can be created with small modification to the existing once becouse inheritance provides the 
fucility of reusability

->due to the modification, oop concept is good for development

->object oriented language provide good quality of softwere, increase in productivity and less maintenanc.

(Disadvantages of oops)
-> the messge-based communication between many objects in a complex system in difficult to trace and debug

->it requires more memory than the traditional programing language

->the reusability of code is not always possible

(Similarities in C and C++)
->C++ is a superset of C it contains the syntax and features of C language

->mast of the basic syntax of C++ is similar to that of except some rules and constructions of its own

->it contains the same control statements the same scope and storeage calass reules even the arithmatic,logical,bitwise
 operators and the data tpe

->both the language start with the main() function;

                                            OOPS                               <<16-02-26>>
opps: object oriented programing

CLASS:
->class is a collection of different different data members

->class is a collection of elements
->class is a user difined data type

syntax:
class <class name>
{
    public:
    data members;
    members function();
};
----------------------------
OBJECT:
->object is a instance of class or we can say thet object is a variable of class

->using of object we can access properties of class

syntex:
classname object=classname();
------------------------------
Constructor:
-> constructor is a most powefull concept of C++ constructor is a special member function
<or we can say that constructor is a special method>

->witch is invoke automatically whnever we creat object of class

-> it's usally work for initilization of member

NOTE: Constructor does not have any return type and constructor always declare in publice
mode.

->constructor name and class name sude be same we can't take different name.

syntax:
class <class name>
{
    public:  
    data members

    constructor:
    {
        body of constructor
    }
}
-------------------------------
ther are 3 type of constructor

1)  defualt constructor
2)  parameterized constructor
3)  copy constructor

1) defualt constructor

-> dose not  contain any parameter when we want display or do some static value we can use 
defualt constructor.

2) parameterized constructor

-> when we pass parameter at object crreation time it's called parameterized constructor

:::this pointer:::

-> thois pointer wich is refer current class object means we can change class member using of this pointer
=========================================
3) Copy constructor

this is special constructor which is creat new object using of existing object

syntax:

constructorname (const classname &obj)
{
    ....
}
hear & means address operetor
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
                                       Destructor :
                                                                               <<20-02-26>>
distructor:
-> mainly work to destroy object whenever we close our block of code it will automatically
destroy object after use same like constructor declare in public mode as destructor declare
declare in public mode

->but in destructor we have to add (~ till sign) in prefix and same name as class name

syntax:

    ~classname
    {
        //body
    };

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Pass by value:
pass by refrence:
pass by address:

1) pass by value:
->fuction parameter we are passing only object it will not affect orignal value

2) pass by refrence:
->we are passing refrence of object so, whenever we apply chang it affect orignal value

3) pass by address:
->here, we are pass address of object so whenever apply changes in address it affect orignal value
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>



                       Access specifier or Visibility mode
                                                                               <<18-02026>>

ther are 3 types of Access specifier

1) public
2) private
3) protected

-> in structure by default all members are public but in class by default all members are private so we 
have to define in public mode.

1) public:
-> we can access class properties from anywher inside the class and outside the class

-> anywhere from the programe

2) private:
-> private means private data-even child class can't use private class data member and member function

-> so, private provide data protection and data hiding in cass functionality

-> only own class can access

3) protected:
->protected is a similar like private but protected member can access by own class child class

-> own class and child class.

                                     Inheritance
                                                                               <<18-02-26>>
Inheritance:
->Inheritance is a most powerful concept of Oops concept
->Inheritance provide reusability so we can reduce our work and save development time
->Inheritance provide parents and child relationalship

ther are 5 types of inheritance:

1) single level inheritance
2) multi level inheritance
3) multiple inheritance
4) hierarchical inheritance
5) hybrid inheritance

-> inheritance is a part of relationalship so it represent IS-A relationalship
   
   parent - child (100% utility of parent's properties)

-------------------------------
1) single level inheritance:

->parent and child relationalship its called single level inheritance

    A   (parent)

    |
    V 

    B   (child)

    syntax:
    class Parentclass
    {
    };
    class Childclass: <access Specifier><Parentclass>
    {
    };
    main()
    {
        Childclass obj;//not prent class
    }
----------------------------------------
2) multi-level inheritance:

-> Extended level of multi level inheritance

syntax:

class A//class A is a super class or base class or parent class
{
};
calss B//class B is a intermediate parent class
{
};
class C// c;class C is a sub calss or derived class or child class
{
};

--------------------------------------
3) multiple inheritance:

->in this inheritance ther are more then one parent class and one child class

-> mens one child can have more then one parent or we can say that multiple parent class

-> but in real world multiple inheritance not supported becouse in real world two parent 
are not possible that's why java does'n support this concept

-> multiple inheritance the main aim to achieve multiple parent's functionality in one chile class

syntax:

class parent1
{

};
calss parent2
{

};
class child:<access spacifier>parent1,<acces spacifier>parent2
{
    
};

-> nut ther are possaibility of ambiugity(confusion between same name properties)


                                    Ambiguty:

-> ther is one problem or we can say that one issoe with inheritance

Ambiguty:
-> ambiguty means when both child imporat (inherite) it genereate confusion its callde ambiguty.

-> unfortunatlly child have 2 same name methods so compiler get confuse which method i have to access first

(::) this is colled scope resolution
which class properties you want to access it.
-----------------------------------
4) Hierarchical iheritance:

-> one parent multipule child class

       A(parent)
       |
       V
----------------
|               |
V               V
B (child 1)     C (child 2)


------------------------------------
5)  Hybrid inheritance:

-> most complicated inheritance because it represent like diamond and it create ambiguty

-> in simple language we can say that hybrid inheriatce is a combbination of multiple and 
hierarchical inhetirance

                         A
            -----------------------------
            |                            |
            B                            C
            \                           /
              \                       /
                \                   /
                  \               /
                    \           /
                      \       /
                        \   /
                          D

{jab brother sister parent ho tab child agar dada ki proparti co call karta ahi to compiler confuje hota hai or ambiguty hota hai }

-> to resolve this diamond problem we can use (virtual) keyword

-> now virtual keyword inform compiler taht you dont have to creat separate copy of parent class inside of seprate copy you can pass dublicate copy so it remove ambiguty

                                 Encapsulation:
                                                                               <<20-02-26>>
-> Encapsulation is a most powerfull conceptof oop concept which bind different diffreent 
data member and member function in single entity and provide data hiding for outside the 
world.


-> encapsulation concept is achieve by class and object examle.

1> data hiding
2> data prevent from outside world
3> security no one can directly change from outside the world
4> data control no one can add unwanted value or apply changes
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
                                       Polymorphism: 
                                                                               <<20-02-26>>
-> poly means many and morphism means froms

-> one method has different forms its called polymorphism
-> polymorphism is derived from greek word means one class can contain same name multipule
method

-> ther are 2 types of polymorphism

1) method overloading - compiler time polymorphism
2) method overriding - run time polymorphism

---------
1) compiler time polymorphism
-> which is also know as early binding and static polymorphism
->which is achieve by method overloading and operator overloading

2) run time polymorphism
-> which is acheiv by method overriding(inheritance) and virtual function
-----------
Method overloading:

when one class can contain same name multipule methods its called method overloading

product:
    ->click event
    (image)
    (button)
    (text)

not: same name method with diffirent signature (diffirent parameters)
