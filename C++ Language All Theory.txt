What is C++ ?
->c++ is an extend varsion of c language
-> C language +1
->c+1
its showing postfix increment
-----------------------------------------
pop        vs      oop

(1)pop
-> praceduare oriented programing language
   wich is mainly focus on functions our all programs divid in chunks of functions

(2)oop
->object oriented programing language
  everythings depends on object
---------------------------
C++:

->C++ is an object oriented programing language it was developed by ((bajarne stroustrup)) at AT & Bell Lab in 1983.

->simula was the first object oriented programing language it was developed during 1960s by kristen nygaard and old dhal

->stroustrup had initially given the name "C with classes" to C++ in 1989, the name was changed to C++.

->C++ can be used to write procedural as well as object oriented that's why C++ is also called a hybride language.
-----------------------------

::object based and object oriented language::

->the language which supports the class and object but does not support the inheritance and
polymorphism is called object based language

->the object-oriented language supports all the features such as class,object,inheritance,
polymorphism,etc.

(1)<oop>object oriented programs              |   (2)<pop>procedure orianted programs

                                              |
->all features of pop may be present in oop   |->it dose not supports the features of oop

->the ffollows the bottom-up dessign concept  |->it follows the top-down design concept
___________________________________________________________________________________________

(Advantage of oops)
-> secarity:The data and functions are combined thogether and the data can be made hidden from the outside world so that security of data increses.

->reusability:new objects can be created with small modification to the existing once becouse inheritance provides the fucility of reusability

->due to the modification, oop concept is good for development

->object oriented language provide good quality of softwere, increase in productivity and less maintenanc.

(Disadvantages of oops)
-> the messge-based communication between many objects in a complex system in difficult to trace and debug

->it requires more memory than the traditional programing language

->the reusability of code is not always possible

(Similarities in C and C++)
->C++ is a superset of C it contains the syntax and features of C language

->mast of the basic syntax of C++ is similar to that of except some rules and constructions of its own

->it contains the same control statements the same scope and storeage calass reules even the arithmatic,logical,bitwise operators and the data tpe

->both the language start with the main() function;

                                            OOPS                               <<16-02-26>>
opps: object oriented programing

CLASS:
->class is a collection of different different data members

->class is a collection of elements
->class is a user difined data type

syntax:
class <class name>
{
    public:
    data members;
    members function();
};
----------------------------
OBJECT:
->object is a instance of class or we can say thet object is a variable of class

->using of object we can access properties of class

syntex:
classname object=classname();
------------------------------
Constructor:
-> constructor is a most powefull concept of C++ constructor is a special member function
<or we can say that constructor is a special method>

->witch is invoke automatically whnever we creat object of class

-> it's usally work for initilization of member

NOTE: Constructor does not have any return type and constructor always declare in publice
mode.

->constructor name and class name sude be same we can't take different name.

syntax:
class <class name>
{
    public:  
    data members

    constructor:
    {
        body of constructor
    }
}
-------------------------------
ther are 3 type of constructor

1)  defualt constructor
2)  parameterized constructor
3)  copy constructor

1) defualt constructor

-> dose not  contain any parameter when we want display or do some static value we can use 
defualt constructor.

2) parameterized constructor

-> when we pass parameter at object crreation time it's called parameterized constructor

:::this pointer:::

-> thois pointer wich is refer current class object means we can change class member using of this pointer
=========================================
3) Copy constructor

this is special constructor which is creat new object using of existing object

syntax:

constructorname (const classname &obj)
{
    ....
}
hear & means address operetor
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Pass by value:
pass by refrence:
pass by address:

1) pass by value:
->fuction parameter we are passing only object it will not affect orignal value

2) pass by refrence:
->we are passing refrence of object so, whenever we apply chang it affect orignal value

3) pass by address:
->here, we are pass address of object so whenever apply changes in address it affect orignal value
