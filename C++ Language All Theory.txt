What is C++ ?
->c++ is an extend varsion of c language
-> C language +1
->c+1
its showing postfix increment
-----------------------------------------
pop        vs      oop

(1)pop
-> praceduare oriented programing language
   wich is mainly focus on functions our all programs divid in chunks of functions

(2)oop
->object oriented programing language
  everythings depends on object
---------------------------
C++:

->C++ is an object oriented programing language it was developed by ((bajarne stroustrup)) at AT & Bell Lab in 1983.

->simula was the first object oriented programing language it was developed during 1960s by kristen nygaard and old dhal

->stroustrup had initially given the name "C with classes" to C++ in 1989, the name was changed to C++.

->C++ can be used to write procedural as well as object oriented that's why C++ is also called a hybride language.
-----------------------------

::object based and object oriented language::

->the language which supports the class and object but does not support the inheritance and
polymorphism is called object based language

->the object-oriented language supports all the features such as class,object,inheritance,
polymorphism,etc.

(Advantage of oops)
-> secarity:The data and functions are combined thogether and the data can be made hidden from the outside world so that security of data increses.

->reusability:new objects can be created with small modification to the existing once becouse inheritance provides the fucility of reusability

->due to the modification, oop concept is good for development

->object oriented language provide good quality of softwere, increase in productivity and less maintenanc.

(Disadvantages of oops)
-> the messge-based communication between many objects in a complex system in difficult to trace and debug

->it requires more memory than the traditional programing language

->the reusability of code is not always possible

(Similarities in C and C++)
->C++ is a superset of C it contains the syntax and features of C language

->mast of the basic syntax of C++ is similar to that of except some rules and constructions of its own

->it contains the same control statements the same scope and storeage calass reules even the arithmatic,logical,bitwise operators and the data tpe

->both the language start with the main() function;
