                                   :FILE HANDLING:
                                                                               <<11-02-26>>
->when we creat any variable it store memory in temporary format wen we close program it 
  destroy memory.
->memory place area is ram not a hardisk
        a=10;

->but after some time if i want to access it so,that time we have to store values or
  memory in hardisk area.

  e.g.:Zoom application-chat
      ,whatsupe-chat

FILE HANDLING:to store variable's value in specific file and to open this kind fileand close file

->ther are 2 type:
(1)text file
(2)binery file

note: file handling which is connected with memory location so it require address so that we use
file pointer concept

int a=10;
char name[20];

FILE *fp; hear file retrive from <stdio.h> header file

fopen();to open specific file
syntex:-   fopen("file name","mode")
fclose; to close specific file
syntex:  fclose(fp);

fprintf(); to write somthing in file
fscanf(); to read form file
-------------
r: read mode
w: write mode
a: append mode
EOF: end of file it's indicate that your file is end now
(like one type '\0')

fgetc(fp): this method accept single single character from file
