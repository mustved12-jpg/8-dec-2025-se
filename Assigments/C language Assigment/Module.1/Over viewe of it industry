(1) what is programe:
->it's a collection of intrection code
==============================================
(2) write a simple "HELLO WORLD" programe and the structure and syntex:
-> syntex:
          {
            printf("STATEMENT");
          }

-> STRUCTURE:

     #include<stdio.h>
     void main()
     {
     printf("HELLO WORLD");
     }
===============================================
(3) explain in your own word what a program and how it functions?
-> program is a set of instructions
-> when we programing using of high level language thats how it's function
===============================================
(4) what is programing ?
-> when we write a satp by satp progarme is called progarming
===============================================
(5) what are the key steps involved in the programing process?
-> problem analysis
-> disigning the solution
-> implementation
-> testing
-> maintenance
===============================================
(6) types of progarming languages?
-> low level language
-> high level language 
===============================================
(7) what are the main difference between high level an low level progarming language?
-> high level language:
    -> easy to understand for human
    -> easy to write
    -> it's worck on compiler or interpreter.
-> low level langauge:
    -> easy to understand for computer
    -> hard to write
    ->it's worck on assembly language.
===============================================
